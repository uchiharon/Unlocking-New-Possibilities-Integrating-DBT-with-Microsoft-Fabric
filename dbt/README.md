Project Contents
================
Ms. Fabric is Microsoft's latest all-in-one analytical platform, and it's designed to give a hands-on experience on integrating dbt with Fabric.

This Project is built using the [DataTalksClubs](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp) Analytical Engineering as starter with a tweak to fit T-SQL, [Microsoft Fabric](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-fabric), [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/)


### Key Takeaways:
- Ms. Fabric Core Concept
- DBT Integration with Fabric

### Prerequisites:

- Ms. Fabric Account
- A dbt Cloud Account
- A GitHub Account
- Basic Understanding of Python & SQL
- Fundamental Knowledge of Analytical Engineering


Deployment & Execution
======================

### Steps for deployment:

- Fork This Project to your git profile, create a branch named dev. This is the repository you would be linking to your dbt account.
- Give DBT adequate access to connect to this repository on your git provider (github/gitlab) -> [see steps](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/cloud/git/connect-github)
- **Create a dbt project** with the name fabric_dbt_integration or any name of choice and point it to the dbt subdirectory of this repository.


### Execution:

1. Create a Fabric Workspace.
2. Create a Data Warehouse, and load data into it.
3. Fork GitHub Repo
4. Creat dbt project
5. Like dbt project to Fabric and GitHub
6. Run dbt job.
7. Preview result.
